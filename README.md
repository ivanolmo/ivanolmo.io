# Personal portfolio site

I built this to move away from my previous site that was built using a template. Practice, practice, practice, and what better way than on my own page?

The site is deployed using **Netlify** and can be viewed at ‚û°Ô∏è [ivanolmo.io](https://ivanolmo.io).

## How it's made

I built this using `React` with `TypeScript` and `Next.js`. I'm learning `TypeScript` at the moment, so although all valid `JavaScript` is also valid `TypeScript`, this site uses a bare amount of actual types. I wanted to get a little experience and deploy something simple before moving on to something where defining types would be beneficial, as I just didn't see the need to define more than a couple for this project.

I chose to use `Next.js` because of previous experience, and because this site will almost certainly be 100% static. `Next.js` is great for serving static content, even if you're not taking advantage of any server side features. I do plan to add a page for each project so that there's space to expand on each one. A few lines of description per project isn't really enough.

I built a nifty little sliding theme switching component using styling from [this blog post](https://h.daily-dev-tips.com/creating-day-night-css-only-toggle-switch), and I incorporated `React` state and a hook called `useTheme` (from the `next-themes` package) that made it really easy to toggle. I'm also checking `localStorage` on mount to check for a user preferred theme, and setting it if it exists.

I used the `typewriter-effect` package for my main headline because I've seen it here and there and I think it's cool. It's only used for 4 words, but I'm a fan of the simple effect.

## Optimizations

There wasn't any real need for many optimizations other than using built in Next.js features like `next/image` along with the `.webp` format for my images. I'm currently using a bunch of `SVG` icons, and I know there's a much more optimized way to use multiple `SVG`'s in a project by using sprites, and that's something I'll revisit in the next day or two.

## Lessons Learned

I did a semi deep-dive into SEO and all the things you can do with `<meta>` tags, so obviously I added all of them üòé Really though, if you take a look at the `<Head>` component in the [`_app.tsx`](/pages/_app.tsx) file, you'll see all the tags I added. I'm still kind of wrapping my head around what each one provides, but I took a look at the tags on the sites of well known devs and most of the tags seem common, so I've joined their club.

Thanks for reading!
